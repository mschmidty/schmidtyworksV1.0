I have a project that is coming up that could impact a golden eagle *(Aquila chrysaetos)* nest.  I wanted to put this note together to get all of the info I have together.  The crux of this note will focus on what we know about eagle disturbance. 

##Taxonomy

* **CLASS**: Aves
* **ORDER**: Accipitriformes
* **FAMILY**: Accipitridie
* **GENUS**: *Aquila*
* **SPECIES**: *chrysaetos*

##Status

* [**IUCN**][IUCN]: Least Concern
* **Colorado BLM**: Sensitive


##General Life History

Can be found across the [Nearctic][Nearctic] and [Palearctic][Palearctic] and on the fringes of the [Indomalaya][Indomalaya] and the [Afrotropics][Afrotropics].  It is infrequent across its range. 

##Food
Feeds on small prey most of the time. Is more of a predator than a scavenger (like the bald eagle). It eats prey up to the size of a fox or a large crane (known to take goats or small deer as well). A pair may hunt together. 

###Habitat

Utilizes a variety of open habitats: tundra, prairie, rangeland, or desert. Wide ranging in the winter.  Is more restrictive in the summer to areas with good nesting habitat. 


##Reproduction
May mate for life. 

###Young
Usually there are 2, sometimes 1-3 but rarely 4, young. Both male and female incubate.  Female usually incubates more. Incubation lasts around 41-45 days. 

The female stays with the young at first, while the male hunts. After the young start to loose their down, the female leaves the nest to help hunt. 

Young first fly 60-70 days after hatching. 

###Nests
Nests are most often high, and well protected, on a cliff face. Also, may nest in large trees or, rarely, on the ground. Typically nests sites are used repeatedly for many years.  Often, within a territory, there will be an alternate nest. Nests are constructed by both sexes with sticks and lined with weeds, grass, leaves, and moss. New material is added each year.  Nests can become quite large.
