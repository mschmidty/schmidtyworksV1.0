I've spent the last several days looking at a habitat improvement project in Gunnison sage-grouse unoccupied critical habitat where we considering using fire as a tool to improve habitat that had been choked out by Oak.  As with any project that involves sage-grouse habitat, invasive weeds were a concern. I used Chambers et. al. publication to help determine the if the areas we were considering had natural resistance invasion of invasive weeds and resiliance when disturbed.
