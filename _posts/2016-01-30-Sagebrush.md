I had to do some research on big sagebrush (*Artemisia tridentata*) subspecies for a project that I am working on.  Here's a little key to the important subspecies. 

##Wyoming Big Sagebrush

Scientific Name 
{: .blog-post-icon} 

*Artemesia tridentata wyomingensis*

Soils 
{: .blog-post-icon}

* frigid, mesic, and xeric soils of silty, clayey, skeletal, and mixed textures
* soil pH ranges from moderately acidic to moderately basic

Precipitation
{: .blog-post-icon}

* greater than 7 inches (200 mm) of annual precipitation
* where the ranges of Wyoming and mountain big sagebrush overlap, Wyoming big sagebrush generally occurs where precipitation is less than 12 inches (300 mm), whereas mountain big sagebrush occurs on wetter sites

  <p>below 7,000 feet (2100 m)(Colorado)</p></li>
  </ul>

##Mountain Big Sagebrush

*Artemesia tridentata vaseyana*

###Soils
* Soils are moderately deep, well-drained, slightly acid to slightly alkaline and characterized by late-melting winter snow cover and summer moisture
* In a landscape-scale study in Wyoming, soils in topographic depressions occupied by mountain big sagebrush had higher organic matter, nutrients and microbial biomass than soils in more exposed (windblown) areas occupied by other vegetation, including basin and Wyoming big sagebrush. The effect was attributed to greater snow accumulation, leading to greater plant and litter biomass accumulation

###Precipitation

* although mountain big sagebrush is the most common sagebrush in the Great Basin pinyon-juniper woodlands, only the wettest and coolest areas of the higher and larger mountain passes have mountain big sagebrush in their woodlands

##Mountain Big Sagebrush

*Artemesia tridentata tridentata*

###Soils
* It commonly grows on well-drained soils in valley bottoms, lower foothill areas or in areas adjacent to drainages. Basin big sagebrush is associated with deep, seasonally dry, well-drained soils on plains, valleys, and foothills
* It frequently coincides with high water tables or deep moisture accumulations
* occurs on stratified sandy loam soils on floodplains or on low stream terraces
* In southeastern Idaho, basin big sagebrush is most abundant on sandy soils or at the sandy end of a soil texture gradient
* Basin big sagebrush is considered intolerant of alkaline conditions, but some ecotypes do grow in association with salt-tolerant plants such as shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), and saltgrass (Distichlis spp.)
* In Utah sites occupied by basin big sagebrush tend to be slightly alkaline whereas those occupied by mountain big sagebrush tend to be slightly acidic 


###Precipitation

* Basin big sagebrush grows in relatively more mesic habitats than other subspecies of big sagebrush
* Precipitation on basin big sagebrush sites ranges from 10 to 18 inches (250-460 mm) per year
