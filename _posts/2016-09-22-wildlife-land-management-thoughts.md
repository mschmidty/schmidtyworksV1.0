I've been working for two years now as a wildlife biologist.  In that time there have been too many days in front of the computer, too little time in the field, two very complicated Gunnison sage-grouse consultations and several controversial projects. Here's a few thoughts on the consultations. 

##Writing for protection
Technical writing is hard.  It's very hard. Particularly when you are writing about poorly studied organisms and their environments. Like sage-grouse.  It isn't that they are necesarily poorly studdied -- as a threatened species they have received more attention than most -- it's that almost all organisms seem to lack information that would help managers effectively protect them.  And this isn't to say we know how to protect them.  We do.  Don't do that would impact species. However, as most land managers know, that is not a practical solution.  So you inevitably are forced to explain how a certain action will impact a species.   For instance, we know that eagles experience greater disturbance at 400m than they do at 800m and that many agencies recomend that active nests are protected by 800m.  But, if some one proposes to put a trail closer at 600m what evidence do we have that 20 users a day will cause abandonment.    There is no evidence.  So we push hard for the 800m. But what if 800m is literally not possible? Would the the 20 users at 600m force an end to the trail?  And how do you use the best avaialble science to communicate impacts of 600m vs 800m when there is no information.  I found myself writing in generalities a lot.
