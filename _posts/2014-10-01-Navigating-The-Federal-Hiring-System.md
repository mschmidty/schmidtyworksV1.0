I just applied for a new job with the federal government.  One week after applying for the position I was notified that I was "not referred" to the selecting officials for the position that I applied for with no justification. Fast forward two days later, for the same job, and after several phone calls and emails to human resources, I was referred to the hiring officials as one of the top candidates for the position.  After telling my story to others I was comforted to hear that I was not the only one that was baffled by the system.  Here's what I've learned. 

##USA Jobs Sucks

For starters I want to make one thing clear.  [USA jobs][usajobs] is terrible, but it's all we have for now.  If you want to be a federal civilian employee, chances are you will have to use it at some point in your career.  So deal with it.   

##The Questionnaire 
The first part of most applications consists of several questions that are supposed to asses how qualified you are for the job that you are applying for. Mine looked something like this:

1. I have no experience in performing this work behavior. 
2. I have limited experience in performing this work behavior. I have had exposure to this work behavior but would require additional guidance, instruction, or experience to perform it at a proficient level.
3. I have performed work in this task as a regular part of a job.  I have performed independently and normally without review by a supervisor or senior employee. 
4. Work in this task has been a central or major part of my job.  I have routinely performed the work and have trained others in performance of this work and others have consulted me as an expert for assistance in performance of this work.

There are two fields of thought for how to approach these questions (Warning - these suggestions will not help you get a job that you have no qualifications for!):

**Stretch your experience or get better at telling the truth.** - First of all, don't [deflate][fedsmith] your answers! Notice how the second to the bottom question includes "regular part of a job". One could argue that "a job" is just one task on one day.  So if you have done it just once without supervision you can answer that with confidence and blame them for not being more specific (this may backfire on you).  I gave you a warning at the beginning, but I'm going to say it again, if you stretch your answers so far that you can't justify them in an interview, you are wasting you and the hiring officials time. Chances are though the hiring official will not even look at these questions. 

**If there is one experience that you have no experience in, lie** - Yep I said it.  LIE.  I have fought over whether or not I should be promoting dishonesty, and frankly I don't think I should. BUT, in this case I think lying might be warranted. Let's say you make it all the way through the questionnaire and you have been able to confidentially answer most of the questions in the "Work has been a central part of my job" category and on the last question you have zero experience.  If you don't stretch your answer, there is a good chance no one will look at your resume, or transcripts. Automatic disqualification.   The bottom line is, if you are filling out the questionnaire and you are regularly selecting 1 or 2, you are wasting your time. 

##Education

When I was notified by USA Jobs that I was not referred, it didn't tell me why. I had assumed that it was because I had not submitted the correct documentation, or not rated high enough compared to the other candidates.  So, and because of habit, I called HR to figure out what "not referred" meant and why I was put in that category. Turns out my application was junked because I was supposedly missing one educational credit in plant biology. 

Most series have an educational component that you must meet to be referred to hiring officials. In my case the qualifications looked like this: 

	"NEED TO LOOK THIS UP"

Once you submit your application an HR person goes through all of the candidates and checks to see which candidates have the correct courses to qualify for a job. In my case, and depending on the HR person, Ecology can count as a plant science (as was the case for me with the Forest Service) or not (as was the case with the BLM).  

I pleaded with HR "I promise you, that class was 2 weeks of plant and 2 weeks of animal research techniques".  You can understand her reluctance to believe me.  I even went as far as to send her the definition of ecology.  But, alas, she would not budge.  

**Don't let this happen to you** - I was told that the only way they would accept my course without additional verifiable information, was if the title of the course had "Animal" or "Plant" in the title. To avoid this fiasco, submit additional information with your education in the section that asks for additional attachments at the end of the questionnaire.  For me all I had to do was send them a copy of the course description from my college course catalog and they accepted Ecology as a plant science. I was also told that a signed letter on official letterhead would also work (this would have applied to my research on plants in "Senior Thesis").

##Be Nice

HR folks get yelled at all the time for doing the best they can at a task that should not be assigned to them, **BE NICE**.
