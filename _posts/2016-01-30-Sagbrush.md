I had to do some research on big sagebrush (*Artemisia tridentata*) subspecies for a project that I am working on.  Here's a little key to the important subspecies. 

##Wyoming Big Sagebrush

Scientific Name 
{: .blog-post-icon} 

*Artemesia tridentata vaseyana*

Soils 
{: .blog-post-icon}

* frigid, mesic, and xeric soils of silty, clayey, skeletal, and mixed textures
* soil pH ranges from moderately acidic to moderately basic

Precipitation
{: .blog-post-icon}

* greater than 7 inches (200 mm) of annual precipitation
* where the ranges of Wyoming and mountain big sagebrush overlap, Wyoming big sagebrush generally occurs where precipitation is less than 12 inches (300 mm), whereas mountain big sagebrush occurs on wetter sites
