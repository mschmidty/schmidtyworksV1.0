I had to respond to comments for a Environmental Assessment I was writing the other day.  Mid-response I realized I had no idea how to effectively repond to comments. So I decided to write up a short post to learn about it. After all, this is an important part of the NEPA project, particularly for projects that the public cares about. 

##From the BLM NEPA handbook

I got most of this from the [BLM NEPA Handbook][handbook].

*"...all substantive comments received before reaching a decision must be considered to the extent feasible [(40 CFR 1503.4)][40 CFR 1503.4]"*.

Agencies are required to respond to [substantive][substantive] comments.  Substantive comments are those that: 

* question, with reasonable basis, the accuracy of information in the EIS or EA. 
* question, with reasonable basis, the adequacy of, methodology for, or assumptions used for the environmental analysis.
* present new information relevant to the analysis.
* present reasonable alternatives other than those analyzed in the EIS or EA.
* cause changes or revisions in one or more of the alternatives.

Questions are generally **NOT** substantive if they: 

* comments in favor of or against the proposed action or alternatives without reasoning that meet the criteria listed above (such as “we disagree with Alternative Two and believe the BLM should select Alternative Three”).
* comments that only agree or disagree with BLM policy or resource decisions without justification or supporting data that meet the criteria listed above (such as “more grazing should be permitted”).
* comments that don’t pertain to the project area or the project (such as “the government should eliminate all dams,” when the project is about a grazing permit).
* comments that take the form of vague, open-ended questions.

Response to comments can result in several response types: 

1. modifying one or more of the alternatives as requested.
2. developing and evaluating suggested alternatives.
3. supplementing, improving, or modifying the analysis.
4. making factual corrections.
5. explaining why the comments do not warrant further agency response, citing cases, authorities, or reasons to support the BLM’s position.

If comments are substantive and if comments fit into necessary modifications 1-4 from above, you may respond in either the final EA or decision record by altering pertinent sections and listing these changes somewhere in the document. If comments do not warrant changes, document why you decided they do not warrant a change in a response somewhere in the EA or decision document.
