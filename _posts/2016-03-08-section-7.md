The basics of what you need in a Section 7 consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. To get background on the Endangered Species Act, check out my older post: [here][ESA]. 

##1. Introduction

**Standard Language**

*"The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 153 et seq.), as amended (ESA or Act) requires lands under federal jurisdiction to conserve and recover listed species and use their authorities in furnace of the purposes of the Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species (50 CFR §402). ESA directs all federal agencies to consult (referred to as section 7 consultation) with the FWS when their activities “may affect” a listed species or designated critical habitat. The Act also mandates that federal agencies contribute to the conservation of federally listed species by utilizing their authorities to conserve (recover) federally listed species so that listing is no longer necessary."*


##1.1 Purpose

**Sandard Language**

*"This biological assessment (BA) analyzes the potential effects of the proposed **INPUT NAME OF PROJECT** on the **INPUT FIELD OFFICE** on federally listed threatened species, and critical habitat, pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544), as amended (ESA).  The following federally listed threatened and endangered animal and/or plant species and critical habitat are addressed in this assessment:**ADD A LIST OF SPECIES TO BE IMPACTED**"*

##1.2 Current Management Direction

**Sandard Language**

*Current management direction for federally listed and proposed threatened and endangered species can be found in the following documents, filed at our office:*

Include a list of Documents that pertain to the project.  Examples:

* ESA
* Migratory Bird Treaty Act
* National Environmental Policy Act
* Resource Management Plans
* Recovery Plans

##2.0 Consultation History

Include any conversations with Fish and Wildlife Service pertaining to the project that occurred prior to submission of the BA. 

##3.0 Proposed Management Action and Alternatives Considered

Give a brief description of the management action and/or any alternatives. Keep this section as short as possible, but include enough detail so that the FWS is aware of all impacts. 

"Remember, FWS/NMFS may be unfamiliar with the proposed action. This section should contain everything they need to fully understand the size, scope, and important components of this action." - National Park Service BA Guide
{: .quote}

Should include:

* What the project or action is;
* where the project is (include map);
* when the action is going to take place, time line/implementation schedule;
* duration - how long wit it take place;
* who is going to do the action and under what authority;
* how the action will be accomplished - e.g. bulldozer, pile driver chain saw, backhoe, etc.;

##4.0 Project Area Description

Short description of the project setting. Make sure to clearly define the analysis area.  Include:

* Description of the project area;
* vegetation communities/ecosystems
* relevant historical condition and past management activities 
* existing developments and human uses
* current management or activities relevant to the project area

##5.0 Pre-field Review

Obtain a species list from [IPAC][ipac] to determine which species and critical habitat must be included for evaluation within the document. 

**Standard Language**

*"A species list from the FWS on **DATE**with all federally listed and candidate species within the project location in **LOCATION** in Colorado was reviewed for this analysis. Using this list, we determined which of those species had a potential to occur within the analysis area (shown in Table **XX** below). Species not known or with no potential of occurring in the analysis area are documented with rationale in Table **XX** and will not be discussed further in this document. Excluded species have been dropped from further analysis by meeting one or more of the following conditions:"*

1. *species does not occur nor is expected in the project area during the time period activities would occur;*
2. *occurs in habitats that are not present; and/or*
3. *is outside of the geographical or elevational range of the species.*

*"In addition, Table 2 below also gives a very brief summary of federally listed/candidate species, designated critical habitat, species’ habitat requirements, and known occurrence information of species that are known or may occur in the analysis area.* 

*"There **IS/IS NOT** designated critical habitat for federally listed species within the analysis area; therefore, critical habitat **WILL/WILL NOT** be addressed further in this assessment."*

##Species Considered and Evaluated

**Standard Language**

*"The following table indicates whether the species from the FWS official species list (dated **DATE**) are known or expected to occur within the analysis/action area, suitable habitat is present, or if not why they are excluded from further analysis (with rationale)."*

It is also useful to include a list of critical habitat as well.

##7.0 Evaluated Species

##7.1 Field Reconnaissance

Have you visited the project site? What surveys have you completed? If surveys have not been conducted, but species is present, assume that the species is there. 

##7.2 Species Status and Biology

Include a brief overview of the species and their biology.  Reference the listing document (federal register) for the majority of their biology.  Only include local relevant information in this section.  Do not repeat general known biological traits. 

##8.0Environmental Baseline

**Standard Language**

*"As defined under the ESA, the environmental baseline includes past and present impacts of all federal, state, and private actions in the action area; the anticipated impacts of all proposed federal actions in the action area that have undergone formal or early section 7 consultation; and the impact of state and private actions which are contemporaneous with the section 7 consultation process. Future actions and their potential effects are not included in the environmental baseline. This section in combination with the previous section defines the current status of the species and its habitat in the action area and provides a platform to assess the effects of the proposed action under consultation with the FWS."*

##8.1 Previous Consultations With the Fish and Wildlife Service Within the Analysis Area

Include all past consultations (Tails#) that have occurred within the basin and a brief description (two sentences) and date that they occurred.

Can be included in a table with: Project, Unit, Type of Project, Species Addressed, Determination, Date.
