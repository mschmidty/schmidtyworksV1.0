The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is one fo the most successful conservation Acts in the United States. When challanged, the supreme court determined that the act was intended to *"halt and reverse the trend toward species exctinction, whatever the cost."*  Here's an intro and a little history on the act that is both loved and hated. 

##History

In the early 1900s, due to the extirpation of the passenger pigeon and the near disappearance of the American bison, extinction was introduced into the American lexicon. Over the next half century, the continued decline of several species due to pesticide use, hunting, collection and habitat degradation, kept the plight of species on the minds of the public.

In 1941, the whooping crane, a bird that ranged from central Canada south to Mexico, from Utah to the Atlantic coast, was reduced to just 16 birds in the wild. The whooping crane's widespread disappearance received great attention at that time and helped gain support for species protection. 

After several laws that were passed that dealt with hunting and game animal management - [the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918][MBTA], a treaty prohibiting hunting right and gray whales, and the [Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940][BGEA] - the mid 1960s saw the passage of laws that dealt with the conservation of species and their habitats. 

In 1966, the Preservation Act was passed by congress.   It  authorized [US Fish and Wildlife Service][FWS] the ability to list US species as endangered, and it allowed them to also spend up to $15 million per year to purchase habitat. The Act also expanded the Secretary of the Interior's ability to purchase and manage the system of National Wildlife Refuges. In 1969, the act was amended to address the world wide trade and sale of species in danger of extinction, and strengthened the restrictions on the interstate commerce of species within the US.

Following the passage of the Preservation Act, Richard Nixon, on December 28, 1973, signed the Endangered Species Act. It followed the passage of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the the National Environmental Policy Act. The bones of the act required federal agencies to contribute to the conservation of listed species, as well as: 

1. Prohibited the import, export or interstate or foreign sale of endangered and threatened animals and plants without a special permit.
2. Made **take** illegal -- forbidding the killing, harming, harassing, pursuing, or removing the species from the wild. 
3. Required federal agencies to conduct their activities to recover listed species. 
4. Required federal agencies to consult (known as Section 7 Consultation) with the FWS to conserve listed species on federal actions that may harm listed species and only carry out activities that will not **jeopardize** the survival of those species and their associated critical habitat. 

##ESA

Surprisingly [ESA][ESA] is only 49 pages and is made up of 18 Sections that lay out how the Service will make "Determination(s) of endangered and threatened species." - Section 4; Penalties - Section 11; and "Interagency Cooperation" - Section 7. Interestingly in Section 2 the act provides a justification for its passage.  ESA states: 

*"...various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States have been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation; (2) other species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been so depleted in numbers that they are in danger of or threatened with extinction; (3) these species of fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people;...*

##Section 7

As a biologist I deal with Section 7 of the act the most. Section 7 states: 

* (2) Federal agencies shall insure, through consultation, that federal actions are *"not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat"* of listed species. 
* (3) *"Federal Agencies shall consult with the Secretary on any prospective agency action at the request of, and in cooperation with prospective permit or license application if the applicant has reason to believe that the endangered or threatened species may be present in the area affected by his project and the implementation of such action will likely affect such species."*
* The section also lays out time frames for consultation, in formal cases it permits the FWS 90 Days once a consultation is submitted to reply with a biological opinion.

##Consultation

At some point, I intend to dedicate a whole blog post to Section 7 consultation.  However, you can't write about ESA as a wildlife biologist without at least briefly touching on consultation.

Federal agencies are required to consult with FWS on any actions undertaken or permitted by them that "may affect" listed species or their critical habitat.  So the first determination that a biologist must make while reviewing a federal action, is to determine the level of affect that a project will have on listed species. This determination can result in a *"**No Effect**"*, *"**May affect, but not likely to adversely affect**"* or *"**May affect, and is likely to adversely affect**"* determination on species.  *"**No effect**"* determinations do not require consultation with FWS, *"**...not likely to adversely affect**"*  determinations require informal consulation with the FWS - a 30 day process that results in a concurrence letter -, and *"**...likely to adversely affect**"* determinations require formal consultation - a 90 day process that results in a Biological Opinion (BO) and incidental take permit if the service concurs that the project will not lead to jeopardy.  Determination of affects should be made based on the following definitions: 

* *"**No Effect**"* means there will be no impacts, positive or negative, to listed or proposed resources. Generally, this means no listed resources will be exposed to the action and its environmental consequences. 
* *"**May affect, but not likely to adversely affect**"* means that all effects are beneficial, insignificant, or discountable. Beneficial effects have contemporaneous positive effects without any adverse effects to the species or habitat. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and include those effects that are undetectable, not measurable, or cannot be evaluated. Discountable effects are those extremely unlikely to occur. These determinations require written concurrence from the Service. 
* *"**May affect, and is likely to adversely affect**"* means that listed resources are likely to be exposed to the action or its environmental consequences and will respond in a negative manner to the exposure.

Consultations that lay out the analysis and rationale behind your effects determination are communicated in the form of a Biological Assessment (BA). A BA, as recommended by the Fish and Wildlife Services [Consultation Handbook][FWSconsultationhandbook], should include the following sections: 

1. Introduction - Purpose of BA and Current Management Direction
2. Consultation History
3. Proposed Management Actions and Alternatives Considered
4. Project Area Description
5. Species Considered and Evaluated
6. Evaluated Species Information
7. Environmental Baseline
8. Effects to Evaluated Species and Determinations
9. Effect Determination Summary
10. Additional Conservation Recommendations
11. Literature Cited

There are many nuances to consultation, how long it will take largely depends on how staffed the FWS is at the time and can take longer than listed in the act. Also, what you should include in your BA can depend largely on the individual assigned to your project at the FWS.  Some individuals prefer very detailed BAs, others prefer concise documents that only contain the very minimum amount of information to make a determination.  Although BAs should include *"the best available science"*, their contents may vary and their creation is something of an art form. Sometimes when writing documents for the federal government it can be easy to get sucked into the *"I am just following a process"* mentality. But it is important to remember the purpose of the act and use consultation to truly analyze project impacts to species and protect those species accordingly.
