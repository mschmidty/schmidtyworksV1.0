Like anything, when putting together a research project it is helpful to have a defined system or process to follow.  Processes and systems help you know what needs to be done, they make sure you don't miss any steps, and they can be iterative, helping you improve over time. 

This post is based on the process that I went through to design a vegetation study of Gunnison sage-grouse habitat. But really it would work with any study.    

##One: Set goals
Step one of the research process is to ask yourself: what do you want to learn, what is my goal, or what question do I have.  At first I had a hard time wrapping my head around this.  I thought with enough random points, and a solid data collection methodology, the data would ultimately answer the *"what do I want to learn question"*.  That might seem a bit dim witted of me but I it seemed hard to ask a question before you had some data to base your question off of.  Like how do I know to look for different types of vegetation in different grazing pastures if I don't know if the vegetation is different in the first place. 

Once I did start with a question, though, things fell in place much easier.  My research goal was: 

*"Why do grouse use the areas that they do?"*

My office put GPS collars on 2 sage-grouse, last year and two more this year.  Before we put the collars out we thought that we had a pretty good idea of where grouse where and why they were using areas. The points proved otherwise.  Grouse were using small concentrated areas that we didn't really thing they would use.  And they weren't all using the same areas.  So we wanted to know why they were using the areas they were.  What were they keying in on.

## Two: Set the Scope of Your Project

How are you going to collect these data so that your goals are met and your questions are answered? Where do you want to collect your information? Has anyone tried to answer the same questions before? How did they get their answer?  Could I do the same thing? What time period should I collect this information for?   

##Three: Gather Existing Information

This is also a good time to figure out if you even need to do the study. Ask yourself: *"Has anyone ever figure this out before?"*  In my experience the answer is usually NO.  There is so little research out there answering really complex question in biology.  And even if someone has done the research before, if you have the time, theres no reason to not repeat a study. 

##Four: Choose a Sampling Unit and a Measurement Technique
