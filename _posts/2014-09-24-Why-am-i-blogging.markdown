This is my first blog post on [schmidtyworks.com][schmidtyworks].  That being the case, I wanted to make some goals for this site and layout why I've decided to put my hat in the blogging ring. First a little bit of background.

##Learning Web Design

Over the past two and a half years I've slowly been digging myself deeper into the world of web design.  I've learned a lot.  Enough to build this site from scratch with state of the art tools that were mostly free.  

I have never taken a single class in computer programming or design. What I've learned has come from some amazing and free online resources. [CSS-Tricks][css-tricks], [tuts+][tuts+], [Treehouse][treehouse], and [Timothy Training][timothytraing], to name a few of the major ones.  Most of the sites that I learned from are either made by one person, CSS-Tricks for example (he has guests occasionally), or are a curated collection of many individuals articles. Regardless, web designers and developers are encouraged to share what they've learned and how they learned it. Thus creating a WEB of shared knowledge and experiences for the betterment of all.

##For Me, Web Development is Just a Hobby 

Building websites is my hobby.  Managing public lands as a biologist is my career.  In biology we don't share much. What we do, is shared in a scientific journal, very long PDF or email.   While these are amazing sources of information, they are hard to read and usually really boring.  My dream is to have a resource where people can go and learn the way that web designers do.  I can't tell you how many times that I have googled something biological and come up with an endless stream of PDFs.  One day I want to google Mexican Spotted Owl Surveys and read a blog post about what issues people ran into and what they've learned instead of a 20 page [PDF][MSOpdf]. We have the internet now.  Make it interactive, responsive and community based. We can do better.

##Where Are You Going With This? 
I care deeply about public land management.  Some of my favorite places in the world are on public lands, and I am fortunate to have the privilege to manage them.  But, I have so much to learn.  Sharing what I am working on in a way that makes sense to someone else is the best way to actively learn something in my opinion.  Learning and teaching is great, but the real beauty of this system of teaching/learning will, hopefully, build a resource that is useful to myself and others. 

[Others are already doing this (not really biology related, but helpful in my field nonetheless)][mfenner] and I'm sure there are more people beginning to share then I realize.  So I want to do my part by sharing my experiences on this blog.  Hopefully I'll learn a lot along the way and create a resource that is useful not just for me, but for those that come after me as well.  
 
##Winter 2014 Goals:

* **Finish the site.**  I still have a lot to do, so I'm going to start simple.  Home page will be my most recent article.  Article page will be an archive page. My Web page will be Web stuff (gotta give back). About page will be about (duh). As of this writing I just have a home page. 
* **Start collecting things that I've learned by doing my job.** I want to write about what I've been working on and learning at work. Hopefully when I'm done I will have a really good resource for myself at the very least. 
* **Add a comments Section to the site.**


That is a lot for the rest of the year.  At the beginning of the year I'll check back in and make some adjustments if need be.  So, here's to a beginning!
