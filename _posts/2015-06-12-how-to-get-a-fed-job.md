I wanted to give you some thoughts on what I know about getting a permanent job with the federal government.  To be fair I don't know everything. But I did manage to work my way up the ladder relatively quickly without a masters degree, starting as a GS-4 seasonal and moving up to a permanent GS-7 within 3 years, and moving to a GS-9 in in another 3.  To sum up how I did it, I think my ascension took luck, hard work and good people skills.  The following is a more comprehensive collection from my own experience, and the experiences of others who I have talked to, of how I think you can best get your foot in the door as a federal employee.  I hope it helps. 

##I Don't Really Know
To start, I'd just like to say that getting a permanent job is very difficult.  There aren't that many jobs to start with and government hiring practices are less than user friendly.  I've met and worked with so many great people who have worked for the feds for a long time, and never gotten a permanent job.  They are great candidates that haven't been in the right place at they right time yet.  To sum up what I've seen, trying to get your first permanent federal job can be discouraging.  I add this disclaimer because I don't want to give up if they apply to a lot of jobs, doing the best they can and they don't succeed.  If you are one of the great employees that is doing all of the things that I have listed below and you still haven't gotten a job, make sure that you are doing whatever you can to increase your chances, but know that it might not be your fault that you haven't gotten a job.  And don't give up keep trying. 

##Move Somewhere that No One wants to Live
If there was a sure fire way to get a permanent job, moving somewhere in the middle of nowhere is it. It seems like the easiest way to get picked up is to move east or to Nevada; or anywhere that people don't want to live.  It makes sense. Jobs are easier to get in areas where there is less competition. It's also a lot easier to get work in a place where people don't want to stick around.  And remember you don't need to stick around either.  You can get that first permanent job, work for a year and apply for a job in your dream location with competitive experience. I see great BLM jobs in Winnemucca, Nevada come up all the time.  And I completely understand why someone would want to avoid Winnemucca (the signs with free rooms off the highway are enough to deter me), but the areas around Winnemucca are stunning - there are more mountain ranges in Nevada than any other state.  Indeed, some of the most impressive, epic and badass areas are in places that no one wants to live.  If you don't believe me, take a drive down highway 50 in Nevada.  It has to be one of the most stunning highways in the American west. If you like solitude, don't move to Colorado, Utah or California move to Nevada, northern New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming or North Dakota. Also remember that good management of the obscure lands is just as important, if not more important, than those that are more coveted by the public.

##Get Experience
I thought when I got an undergraduate degree in biology that I had done my learning.  I hadn't. High school, undergraduate  or graduate school don't teach you about the real world, they teach you how to learn and how to cope with doing new things regularly.  After being in the working world, it has become apparent to me that it is impossible to learn everything that you need for a professional job in an academic setting.  There is no way to become an expert in a field until you've done it for at the very least a decade.  Even then there will always be something to learn and improve on.  

College is particularly bad at preparing you for federal jobs.  If you want to be a fed you need to learn how to handle extremely complex bureaucracy.   On the job training can teach you how to manage both your work, the lack of funding and the millions of trainings that you are required to take annually. And these skills are very important to the people that are hiring you.  So emphasize that you can do them if you have the experience. 

Years on the job will also give you skills you never thought you needed.  I love working with other people because I always learn something new from them and can apply those techniques to future work.  Even folks that work for me, teach me stuff all the time. What you learn from supervisors will be invaluable in your future career. I can't count how many times I've come into a situation where I had a plan and was ready to execute when someone else had an idea that was much simpler and efficient. 

##Stick Around
One thing that helped me in comparison to many of the people that I have worked with is that I stayed in the same office for longer than any of my co-workers (this contradicts my first point of moving, but....).  To be fair, I didn't really stick around in Colorado because I wanted to.  I stuck around because I had a girlfriend here that I loved and I didn't want to leave her.  I was lucky though because everyone that I worked with eventually left.  If I hadn't had someone to stick around for I would have done the same, but I did stick around, and after four years of waiting,  my boss left. I applied for his job and I got it. And then I stayed around for another three years and my boss left again.   In 7 years I had moved from a seasonal GS-4 to a permanent, professional series, GS-9 wildlife biologist with no masters degree. I was lucky (damn lucky!) but I believe I gave myself a good chance of getting a permanent job because the people hiring me knew and liked me, and I was loyal to them.    

##Make Friends
I don't care how good you are at your job or how lucky you are, no one will hire you if they don't like you or they don't know you. One of my supervisors and I were on a hiring panel together. I was on the panel to give advice and my supervisor was the final decision maker.  There were three candidates left and two were already working in our office.  When we were discussing the candidates the two from our office were both very qualified for the position.  However, neither of them had ever stepped foot into my supervisor's office, even though they wanted the job. How can you expect to work with someone who avoids you? This also makes it very difficult to get a job in an office where you have never worked. If you haven't worked in an office call them (it can be difficult to find the number for the person hiring you, if you make the effort people will be impressed).

You've heard it before and I'm going to say it again.  Network dammit!  If you are in a tie when it comes down to hiring, or your ranked slightly lower,  if the hiring official really likes you they will hire you. If they don't like you or they don't know you, you're probably out.

##Diversify Your Portfolio
You are easier to hire if you have a diverse skill set. This is probably the most important suggestion in this post.  If you want to be a wildlife biologist, don't just try to work with wildlife.  Get really good at GIS, or range, or hydrology.  If you apply for a job where they need a wildlife biologist with another experience that you have, you will automatically place hire another candidate.  Getting that extra experience is easy too. With small underfunded field offices and districts it is really easy to get out and help other departments, especially if they have a little extra money. You will also potentially be able to get a permanent job with that department if a position opens. People will always hire someone that they know over someone who is unknown to them if you do a good job. 

This is kind of the same as going above and beyond. If you have the opportunity to do your bosses job for a while, do it.  Even if they don't pay you for it.  That extra experience could be the difference between you and someone else. 

##Your Resume Needs to Be Perfect!
Your resume needs to be perfect.  That's right, perfect. Especially if the people doing the hiring don't know you.  For a while I hated this.  I used to think that people make mistakes. I make them all the time (Yikes grammar is hard). But if you have one mistake in your resume, I know a lot of people who will throw your resume away immediately.  It's true, hiring should be done based on qualifications, but life isn't fair. I've had hiring lists with 800 candidates on them (that was a seasonal list, permanent jobs are usually much smaller).  When you have 800 candidates to get through, you are looking for any excuse to eliminate people. So make your resume perfect. Don't let it be why you didn't get the job. Have everyone read it.  Your brother, sister, mother, father, friend, roommate, co-worker, neighbor, cat, hamster....everyone. 

##Did I Mention Luck
Not everyone is lucky.  I've seen it happen over and over again.  Someone works their ass off, puts in their time, and becomes very proficient at their job and a job opens up and they get passed over for no good reason. It sucks. But it will probably happen to you. So do the best you can to swing that probabilistic scale your way. And remember, when you are trying to get in, it isn't going to be easy.  I've seen more than one person (so two) give up on a permanent job only to realize that giving up was a terrible decision. And by leaving and "trying something else" they put themselves back and made it harder to break into the permanent threshold. 

##Closing
In closing, getting a permanent federal job is by no means easy, but it can happen. And don't look at the above suggestions as the sum total of all possibilities for getting a job.  They are suggestions from my experience.  Ask people that you work for and with or others who have gotten on-board.  

##Good Luck!
