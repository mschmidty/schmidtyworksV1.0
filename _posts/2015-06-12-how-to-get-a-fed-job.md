I wanted to give you all some thoughts on what I know about getting a permanent job with the federal government.  To be fair I don't know everything. But I did manage to work my way up the ladder relatively quickly without a masters degree, starting as a GS-4 seasonal and moving up to a permanent GS-7 within 3 years, moving to a GS-9 in in another 3.  To sum up how I did it, I think my ascension took luck, hard work and good people skills.  The following is a more comprehensive collection from my own experience and the experiences of others who I have talked to of how I think you can best get your foot in the door as a federal employee.  

##I Don't Really Know
To start, I'd just like to say that getting a permanent job is very difficult.  There aren't that many jobs to start with and government hiring practices are less than user friendly.  I've met and worked with so many great people who have worked for the feds for a long time, and never gotten a permanent job. They are great candidates that haven't been in the right place at they right time yet.  I add this disclaimer because I don't want to discourage people.  If you are one of the great employees that is doing all of the things that I have listed below and you still haven't gotten a job, make sure that you are doing whatever you can to increase your chances, but know that it might not be your fault that you haven't gotten a job.  Keep trying. 

##Move Somewhere that No One wants to Live
It seems like the easiest way to get picked up is to move east or to Nevada; or anywhere that people don't want to live. There's no better way to get a great federal job than moving somewhere where you will have less competition for your job. It's also a lot easier to get work in a place where people don't want to stick around.  In really desirable locations, people tend to stick around, making openings sparse. 

I see great BLM jobs in Winnemucca, Nevada come up all the time.  And I completely understand why someone would want to avoid Winnemucca. But the areas around Winnemucca are stunning(there are more mountain ranges in Nevada than any other state).  Indeed, some of the most impressive, epic and badass areas are in places that no one wants to live.  If you don't believe me, take a drive down highway 50 in Nevada.  It has to be one of the most stunning highways in the American west. If you like solitude, don't move to Colorado, Utah or California move to Nevada, northern New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming or North Dakota. Also remember that good management of the obscure lands is just as important, if not more important, than those that are more coveted by the public.

##Stick Around
I thought when I graduated that I had done my learning.  I hadn't. High school, undergraduate  or graduate school don't teach you crap about the real world, they teach you how to learn and how to cope with doing new things regularly.  It is impossible to learn everything that you need to for a job in an academic setting.  Will you learn work ethic? Yes. Will you learn how to work a lot? Maybe. Will you learn the basics of a major? Yes? Will you be an expert? Not even close.  There is no way to become an expert in a field until you've done it for at the very least a decade.  Even then there will always be something to learn.  

Interestingly, college is particularly bad at preparing you for federal jobs.  Not that you don't need to learn the science behind your field - school is great at teaching you that - it's the bureaucracy.  Only the government has governmental bureaucracy at a level that will make you tear your hair out.  On the job training can teach you how to manage both your work, the lack of funding and the millions of trainings that you are required to take annually. 

What you learn from supervisors will be invaluable in your future career.  Only those that have walked through the fire can tell you what color and how hot the fire actually is.  I can't count how many times I've come into a situation where I had a plan and was ready to execute when my boss laid out a much simpler way to complete something. So stick around. You'll thank your older self. 

##People Leave Faster than You Would Think
To be fair, I didn't really stick around in Colorado because I wanted to.  I stuck around because I had a girlfriend here that I loved and I didn't want to leave her.  I was lucky though because everyone that I worked with eventually left, finding a better job somewhere else.  If I hadn't had someone to stick around for I would have done the same, but I did stick around, and after four years of waiting,  my boss left. And then I stayed around for another three years and my boss left again.   In 7 years I had moved from a seasonal GS-4 to a permanent, professional series, GS-9 wildlife biologist with no masters degree. I was lucky (damn lucky!) but I believe I gave myself a good chance of getting a permanent job because the people hiring me knew and liked me.   

##Did I Mention Luck
Not everyone is lucky.  I've seen it happen over and over again.  Someone works their ass off, puts in their time, and becomes very proficient at their job and a job opens up and they get passed over. For no good reason. And it sucks. But it will probably happen to you. So do the best you can to swing that probabilistic scale your way. 

##Make Friends
I don't care how good you are at your job or how lucky you are, no one will hire you if they don't like you or they don't know you. One of my supervisors and I were on a hiring panel together. I was on the panel to give advice and my supervisor was the final decision maker.  There were three candidates left and two were already working in our office.  When we were discussing the candidates the two from our office were both very qualified for the position.  However, neither of them had ever stepped foot into my supervisor's office, even though they wanted the job. How can you expect to work with someone who avoids you?  

You've heard it before and I'm going to say it again.  Network dammit!  If you are in a tie when it comes down to hiring, or your ranked slightly lower,  if the hiring official really likes you they will hire you. If they don't like you or they don't know you, you're probably out.

##Never Give Up
When you are trying to get in, it isn't going to be easy.  I've seen more than one person (so two) give up on a permanent job only to realize that giving up was a terrible decision. And by leaving and "trying something else" they put themselves back and made it harder to break into the permanent threshold. 

##Diversify Your Portfolio
This is probably the most important suggestion in this post.  If you want to be a wildlife biologist, don't just try to work with wildlife, work to diversify your skill set as much as possible.  Get really good at GIS, or range, or hydrology.  If you apply for a job where they need a wildlife bio that can do some hydrology, your in.  Getting that extra experience is easy too. With small underfunded field offices and districts it is really easy to get out and help other departments, especially if they have a little extra money. You will also potentially be able to get a permanent job with that department if a position opens. People will always hire someone that they know over someone who is unknown to them if you do a good job. 

##Your Resume Needs to Be Perfect!
That's right perfect, especially if the people doing the hiring don't know you.  I used to hate this.  People make mistakes, I make them all the time (Yikes grammar is hard). But if you have one mistake in your Resume, I know a lot of people who will throw your resume away immediately.  It's true, hiring should be done based on qualifications, but life ain't (hehehe - its my blog) fair and when you have 800 candidates to get through, you are looking for any excuse to eliminate people. So make your resume perfect. Have everyone read it.  Your brother, sister, mother, father, friend, roommate, co-worker, neighbor, cat, hamster....everyone. 

##Closing
In closing, getting a permanent federal job is by no means easy, but it can happen. And don't look at the above suggestions as the sum total of all possibilities for getting a job.  They are suggestions from my experience.  Ask people that you work for and with or others who have gotten on-board.  

##Good Luck!
