This summer I have had the fortune of being a part of two very controversial projects.  The projects were controversial both within our office - not everyone agreed on the course we should take - and outside of our office - other agencies and the public disagreed with what we wanted to do. As a wildlife biologist I wanted the science to speak for itself.  My arguments would go, here is the research, it says this, so we should do X.  But in negotations with collegues, the public and outside agencies, what I was saying was not being received as I thought I was saying it - there was a lot of mistrust.  Arguements to me, rightly so, would go something like: "but I've seen X so what your saying can't be right". This post is my first attempt at guidelines for communicating my craft, biology, to everyone - the public, managers, outside agencies, etc. 

##Short....But detailed
Government documents are long.  Particularly documents concerning biological effects. The problem with long documents, however, is someone has to read them.  And they can be very boring.  

This casuses several problems: 1) people weren't actually reading all of the documents that wrote, 2) I couldn't remember what I had written, 3) other people couldn't remember what I had written. I spend hours on the phone going over what I had written with people finding little tid bits of information.   I'd like to note that so often someone would call and say: "why didn't you adress X" or "why didn't you count y" and I actually had.  It was just that they couldn't find that particular peice within my 50+ pages of writing.  

Here's some ideas on how to reduce length in documents, but keep them sufficiently long that they have enough detail or how to add detail with out bogging down the document:

###Incorporate by reference
Incorporate as much detail by reference as I can.  Don't repeat the science within the document.  I so often got bogged down becuase I had summarized so much scientific information. 

###Lists
List as much information as you can in simple bulleted information.  It is true that bulleted information can be more difficult to read than paragraphs. However, it is much easier to reference. This is very important because is seems to me that the information in a BA is read once and then references several times after that during conversation or while USFS is writing a response. 

###Summaries
Sumarizing information at the end of a long section, hopefully, helps them review what they have just read.  It also, I hope will help people find information that they need when they need it without reading details. 

###Walk throughs when ambiguous. 
A couple of times I've had people find something that I didn't describe clearly and say: "how were we supposed to know what you meant?".  As if, even though they know exactly what you are trying to say, if you don't spell out what you are trying to say, people will question you. 

##Meet People in Person
In the last three days, I've met and come up with solutions with three people who I have had irreconcilable differences with over the phone. It was miraculous.  Phone conversations, in my experience, seem to be difficult for a lot of people.  There is something abou not being able to read peoples body language that makes communicating with people difficult. Some people are better on the phone than others.  I don't think that I am particularly good, but some people are aweful. 

Today, I was out with someone from another agency.  They were worried about our proposal to use prescribed fire to improve Gunnison sage-grouse critical habitat because of the potential for cheatgrass invasion.  To be fair in most of Gunnison sage-grouses range, their concerns were warrented. But these areas are dominated by Gamble Oak with a sagebrush understory. This is unlike most habitas which are dominated by sagebrush with some areas having oak. 
Because of the sites unique characteristics, showing them the sight was critical to our negotiations.  Telling people what an ecosystem looks like, in writing or verbally, is much less effective than showing them.  

###Be Open
During our visit, the person from the FWS kept pushing everyone there to get ideas out.  No matter how good or bad they were. This freed up the dialogue for everyone.  We told them exactly what we wanted.  They told us exactly what they wanted.  After what each party wanted was on the table we could really start to compromise. And we did.  Solutions were soon reached.  But it wasn't until we layed everything out that we could come together.
