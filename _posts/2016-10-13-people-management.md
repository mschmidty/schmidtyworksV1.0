This summer I have been part of two very controversial projects. As a wildlife biologist I wanted the science to speak for itself.  My arguments would go, here is the research, it says this, so we should do X.  But in negotiations with colleagues, the public and outside agencies, what I was saying was not being received as I thought I was saying it - there was a lot of confusion and mistrust.  Arguments to me, rightly so, would go something like: "but I've seen X so what you're saying can't be right". Part of the problem is that the public doesn't necessarily understand how science works. But the confusion wasn't just coming from the public, it was coming from other scientists too. This post is my first attempt at creating guidelines for communicating my craft, biology, to everyone - the public, managers, outside agencies, etc. 

##Short....But detailed
Government documents are long.  Particularly documents concerning biological effects. The problem with long documents, however, is someone has to read them.  And they can be very boring. Long and boring documents in my experience cause two problems: 1) people don't actually read the document, 2) I couldn't remember what I wrote in the document, 3) other people couldn't remember what I had written if they did read the document. I spend hours on the phone going over what I had written with people finding little tid bits of information.   I'd like to note that so often someone would call and say: "why didn't you address X" or "why didn't you count y" and I actually had.  It was just that they couldn't find that particular piece within my 50+ pages of writing.  So I think decreasing the length of a document is important.  

Here are some ideas on how to do that:

###Incorporate by reference
Incorporate as much detail by reference as I can.  Don't repeat the science within the document.  I so often get bogged down because I had summarized so much scientific information. I don't want to remove this all together. What I have been doing up to this point is going through the pertinent science one paper at a time or one subject at a time. Giving more detail than is probably necessary. A more broad summary with citations would probably suffice. Scientist should either know or be able to find the details of the studies through citation, and the public usually has a better chance of not getting lost if they don't have to weed through dense material.  There's a reason most people don't read text books.  

Over simplification can be bad too. That doesn't mean you shouldn't include all of the pieces that make up an argument it's just that, eliminating the very fine details can help your document read better and help decrease the length of your document. For example:

**Bad**:  *"Steidle et. al. (1993) found when observers were camped 400m (1300 ft or 1/4 miles) from golden eagle nests, adults spent less time near their nests, fed juveniles less frequently, and fed themselves and their juveniles up to 67% less food than when observers were camped 800m (2600 ft or 1/2 mile) away from nests."*  

**Good**: *"Minor disturbances within 800m (1/2 mile) of active golden eagle nests decreases the likelihood of nest success (Steidle et. al. 1993)."*

###Lists
List as much information as you can in lists.  It is true that lists can be more difficult to read than paragraphs. But lists tend to be much easier to reference. This is very important because is seems to me that the information in a BA is read once and then references several times after that during conversation or while USFS is writing a response. 

###Summaries
Sumarizing information at the end of a long section, hopefully, helps them review what they have just read.  It also, I hope will help people find information that they need when they need it without reading details. 

###Walk throughs when ambiguous. 
A couple of times I've had people find something that I didn't describe clearly and say: "how were we supposed to know what you meant?".  As if, even though they know exactly what you are trying to say, if you don't spell out what you are trying to say, people will question you. 

##Meet People in Person
In the last three days, I've met and come up with solutions with three people who I have had irreconcilable differences with over the phone. It was miraculous.  Phone conversations, in my experience, seem to be difficult for a lot of people.  There is something abou not being able to read peoples body language that makes communicating with people difficult. Some people are better on the phone than others.  I don't think that I am particularly good, but some people are aweful. 

Today, I was out with someone from another agency.  They were worried about our proposal to use prescribed fire to improve Gunnison sage-grouse critical habitat because of the potential for cheatgrass invasion.  To be fair in most of Gunnison sage-grouses range, their concerns were warrented. But these areas are dominated by Gamble Oak with a sagebrush understory. This is unlike most habitas which are dominated by sagebrush with some areas having oak. 
Because of the sites unique characteristics, showing them the sight was critical to our negotiations.  Telling people what an ecosystem looks like, in writing or verbally, is much less effective than showing them.  

###Be Open
During our visit, the person from the FWS kept pushing everyone there to get ideas out.  No matter how good or bad they were. This freed up the dialogue for everyone.  We told them exactly what we wanted.  They told us exactly what they wanted.  After what each party wanted was on the table we could really start to compromise. And we did.  Solutions were soon reached.  But it wasn't until we layed everything out that we could come together.
