If you are a federal land manager, the holy grail of all statutes is the [National Environmental Policy Act of 1970][nepawiki], or NEPA, as most of us like to call it. So what exactly is NEPA and why is everyone always talking about it? 

##History

In the early 1960s, due to several environmental catastrophes, the United States public started to pressure the federal government to pass legislation that protected the environment.  Over the next decade and a half several environmental statues were passed: Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA.  NEPA was enacted to help federally funded projects consider not just projects cost, efficiency, and development, but projects effects to the environment as well. The preamble lays out NEPA's purpose nicely: 

"To declare national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation..."

tldr: NEPA helps us prevent environmental damage.

##What is NEPA?

Whenever a federal action occurs, NEPA requires that we analyze that action's affects on the natural environment. This allows both federal employees and the public to be informed of federal actions and allows for an inclusive planning process. Within the government, it requires biologists, ecologists, archaeologists, hydrologists, etc. to analyze effects of a project to the natural and cultural environment. And it requires the public to be informed of future actions and give them a chance to comment on actions before they are implemented. 

##How is it Done?

So, what do federal agencies have to do to comply with NEPA? All actions have to be analyzed and documented in one or more of the following documents: 

1. **[Categorical Exclusion(CatEx)][catex]** are: *"a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency...* therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required._" ([40 C.F.R. §1508.4][catexcfr]) 
2. **[Environmental Assessment (EA):][ea]** If a proposed action does not fall within CatEx, your first step in the NEPA process is an EA. Through environmental analysis in an EA, two outcomes can result: (a) a finding of no significant impact (FONSI), in which case the project may continue [(40 CFR §1508.9)][eacfr]; or (b) you find that the action will lead to **significant** impacts and further analysis is required in an: 
3.  **[Environmental Impact Statement (EIS):][eis]** are used to help make informed decisions on projects that will have **significant** environemtal effects. 

##What is Significant?
During the course of taking various introductory NEPA courses, I really couldn't figure out how to define significance.  And, being that one of the most important NEPA decision is to determine significance, it was frusturating to find that the threshold for significance was so ambigouse and difficult to figure out. So what do the regulations say:

In general to determine significance, you must consider both "context" and "intensity" of an action.

**Context:** "This means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. For instance, for a site-specific action, significance would usually depend upon the effects in the locale rather than in the world as a whole. Both short-term and long-term effects are relevant." [(40 CFR §1508.27)][significance]
{: .quote }

And

**Intensity** "This refers to the severity of effect. Responsible officials must bear in mind that more than one agency may make decisions about partial aspects of a major action….” [(40 CFR §1508.27)][significance]
{: .quote }

What I get out of all of that is that "It depends".  What I am coming to understand more and more is that NEPA is not always a clear path, but more often a helpful guide. After reading the CFRs I didn't really understand how to come to a significance determination clearly. I did see a good example that helped me understand context and intensity better: 

"...let’s say a project would adversely affect 1 acre of salamander habitat. The impact would be significant if it were the last acre of habitat in the state, but would not be significant if there were a million acres of habitat in the state." [(BLM NTC)][BLMNTC]
{: .quote}

##What's Important?

So if significance is ambiguous, what is NEPA really for.  Well, I'm not really the one to ask but.... It seems like what is most important about NEPA is analyzing project effects and laying out your rationale for the decisions that you ultimately will make with that rationale. In other words, if you determine what effect your project will have on the human environment and then take that analysis and clearly explain how you came to a conclusion you are doing NEPA. 

##In Closing
If there's one thing that I've learned about NEPA its that its a hard topic to grasp completely without doing it a lot.  It always baffles me how almost everyone I ask interprets how to do NEPA correctly, differently.  So if you're like me, and you have just started working on NEPA, hopefully you don't get too wrapped up in the right or wrong way to do it.
