  <h2>My Name is Mike Schmidt</h2>


  <p>
    Welcome to my blog that explores being a federal wildlife biologist and technician.  Hopefully this site, one day, will be a resource that both you and I can reference for information on species, writing NEPA, best practices on storing data, and workflow tips.  If you are thinking about hiring me <a href="{{"about/resume.pdf" | prepend:site.baseurl}}">here's a copy</a> of a recent federal resume.

  <h2>Why am I blogging?</h2>


  <p>
    I answered this question on <a href="http://www.schmidtyworks.com/blog/science/2014/09/24/Why-am-i-blogging.html">my first post</a>. More Generally, I made this site to learn about my career and share what I have learned.  I get very frusturated trying to find information about my profession.  Most available information comes in the form of a .pdf. I want to change that.  This website is my resource for the masses. If you have an idea or something you would like to contribute, please contact me @ schmidtyworks@gmail.com.

  <h2>This Website</h2>


  <p>
    As a hobby, I dabble in front end web design.  In the future (maybe V2.0) there will be a section of this blog (or maybe a whole new site) on web design, but for now, and to keep my workload manageable, here are two projects built designed and built using wordpress: <a href="http://durangoshadecompany.com">Durango Shade Company</a> and <a href="http://tealstetsonlee.com">Teal Stetson-Lee | Professional Mountain Biker and Female Athlete Advocate</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Most biologists can skip this part) This website is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Some of the other tools I have used to make this site are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to generate my static site. </li>
    <li> <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> as a task manager.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> as my preprocessor.</li>
    <li> <a href="http://github.com">Git and Github </a> for version control and deployment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I love the nerdy stuff.  If you are at all interested in web development, please contact me @ schmidtyworks@gmail.com. I would love to work on a project with you!

  <h2>Photography</h2>

  <p>
    You will see many images on this website to break up the monotony of federalism. My goal is to only include my own photos.  However, another goal of mine is to make this website as burden free, to myself and the user, as possible (thus the really simple design).  My thought is, if it takes too much time to create I will contribute less. So if I do end up using some photos that are not mine, I'll credit the photos that are not mine.
