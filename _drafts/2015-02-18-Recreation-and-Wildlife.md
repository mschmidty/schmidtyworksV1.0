I recently attended the [Colorado Chapter of the Wildlife Societies' annual conference][CTWSconf]. One of the themes of the conferences focused on wildlife, recreation conflicts. As a wildlife biologist that deals with recreation impacts to wildlife often, and as an avid recreater, the topic was brought up some very interesting points.  

###Recreation is growing
In the United States outdoor recreation [appears to be increasing][RecTrends] (someone needs to compile a more convincing set of data [here][outdoorfound]). While there is little evidence that shows specific activity participation trends over long periods, there is [evidence to support][longRecTrends] that there is an increase in outdoor recreation participation in general. From 1960 to 1995 outdoor recreation participation increased from 131 million to 216 million participants, an increase of 65%.   From my experience, in the United States, particularly in the west, it appears that we are quickly becoming a recreation centered culture. Outdoor activities are in vogue.  


###Recreation has a negative impact
As recreation grows it is having an increasingly negative impact on ecosystems. Outdoor recreation was listed as the 2nd greatest threat to federally listed threatened and endangered species [(Losos et. al. 1995, paywall)][LososPub] in the US and the 4th greatest threat globally. Interestingly, around 50% of recreaters  think that they have an impact on wildlife. I can see this [(Taylor and Knight, 2003)][taylor].  Working for the BLM it seems that more and more people have agreed that the usual suspects such as oil and gas development and logging impact ecosystem.  Even some types of recreation are seen as having an impact such as four wheeling and dirt biking. But, few people realize that other forms of recreation also have an impact.  Take Mountain Biking for example.  43.3 million people rode a mountain bike at least once in 2000.  That's over 1/10th of the total Unites States population. In our area it is problematic because the areas that currently have trails or where people want to build trails are some of the few areas left that still have reasonable value for a many wildlife species. And by no means are Mountain bikers the only problem.  Rock Climbing is taking over important raptor, swallow, corvid and bat nest and roost areas nationwide, and very few studies have been conducted to determine what impacts this is having if any at all. I could go on, hiking, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling.  All habitats appear to be under pressure by at least one recreation activity. 

###It's not the only issue
There are other issues as well.  Not only is recreation growing, but concurrently, so are the areas that humans inhabit.  Cities are growing. Small towns that were once dots on the map are now recreation destination and during certain periods of the year can double in size.  Ranching and farming lands that were once made up of vast single family parcels that provided open space are being subdivided. More and more open space is being occupied or accessed, decreasing its effectiveness for wildlife. Plots of land that were once owned as open space are being bulldozed for new hospitals, housing developments, restaurants, office buildings and dumps. 

###What to do. 
So what do we do? I don't honestly know.  At the same time that we are seeing greater outdoor recreation impacts, we are seeing younger generations more excited to get outside.  This is especially important considering national obesity levels. 

And recreation isn't evil. I recreate more than most. I ride mountain bikes a couple of times a week, I climb on the weekends in the southwest, I backpack in pristine areas, I fish. I love recreation. 

However, I think those of us that do recreate need to take a hard look at the activities that we participate in and figure out a way that we can minimize our impact.  Because if we don't we are going to degrade the outdoor places that we love to visit to the point that they will no longer be the places that we wanted to visit in the first place.  We need to stop demanding that there are more areas, more trails, more runs, more access.  Some areas need to be saved. 

I'd love to hear what y'all think!
