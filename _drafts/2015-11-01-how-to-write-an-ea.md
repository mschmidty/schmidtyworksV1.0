I'm going through my first big Environmental Assessment.  To get my head wrapped around the process, I thought that it would be good for me to write a post about the very basics of what should be included.  

##What is an EA? 

If you are not completely sure what an EA is or how it is involved with land management or the NEPA process, take a quick look at my previous post that goes over the basics of NEPA ###ADD IN LINKE TO NEPA PAGE###. 

In short and EA should contain: 

* the need for the proposal
* the alternatives considered
* the environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives
* listing of agencies and persons consulted

##What does that Mean?

To me, the intro to NEPA classes really teach you all of the wrong things.  They teach you the stuff that is above with a lot of information that you don't really need to know at first. In my opinion that is one of the reasons why so many people have such a hard time with what to do when they are in charge of writing their first NEPA document.  So what is an EA? 

The best way to think about it is an If/Then document.  It's trying to figure out if you do this than what will happen.  For example: if I decide to go for a two mile run, (than)it would be relatively fun and I could probably do it without ease. However, if I go for a 10 mile run, (than) my ass will probably be really tired and I might not make it. I can pick to do either, but now after going through an alternative comparison, I can make an informed decision about what I want to do.
