The holy grail of all statutes is the [National Environmental Policy Act of 1970][nepawiki], or NEPA as most of us like to call it. So what exactly is NEPA and why is everyone always talking about it? 

Note: I am not a NEPA expert.  Far from it actually, if anyone out there is interested in contributing to this discussion that is a NEPA expert, I would love to hear from you or, even better, have you write a guest post. Contact me at schmidtyworks@gmail.com. 

##Why do we have NEPA?

The preamble lays out a purpose and need nicely: 

"To declare national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation..."

tldr: NEPA helps us prevent environmental damage. 

##What is NEPA?

##Environmental Assessments (EA), Environmental Impact Statements(EIS) and Categorical Exclusions (CA. 

NEPA can be broken down into three categories:

1. **[Environmental Assessments (EA):][ea]** Your first step in the NEPA process is an EA. Through environmental analysis, two outcomes can result: (a) a finding of no significant impact (FONSI), in which case the project may continue; or (b) you find that the action will lead to significant impacts and further analysis is required in an: 
2. **[Environmental Impact Statements:][eis]** 
3. **Categorical Exclusion:**
