Bureaucracy is something that you must accept as a government employee, or you will go crazy.  And I have.  I told myself that the day that I got a gov job, that no matter how mundane the bureaucracy got, I would get it done, and not let it interfere with my job.  But recent attempts at trying to get two programs have changed my mind and after [reading around][fedramp], I think things need to change. 

##Money

The government is huge.  I mean the US federal government  [ budget was 4 trillion dollars][budget] in 2015.  As you can imagine, an entity with that much money tends to employ a lot of people, which the government does, approximately [2.7 million][workforce]. Like many large corporations with that many employees I, there are many systems the the government uses to keep some sort of order within such a large workforce. Some of these systems are very necessary such as a hiring staff or an accounting staff (often outsourced these days).  However, some of these systems tend to get very large very quickly and, because of their size, end up costing a ton of money.  

Government systems become large for many reasons, politics, money, very persuasive leaders, etc.  But one particular form of growth seems to be very destructive within the government.  A very common scenario is a government employee or user gets hurt, says the government agency whom they are connected to didn't do enough to protect them, so they sue.  Let's, in an imaginary scenario, assume that they [win][lawsuit] and their settlement costs uncle Sam a lot of money.  The government pays the settlement, and changes policy to prevent such a lawsuit in the future. As it should be, the government should try to protect their employees and users.  But now let's assume that it happens 100 times or 1,000 times.  Understandably the government starts to fear future suits and begins to institute safety precautions preemptively.  Now let's say that these new precautions work, so the system grows.  Injuries, and therefore lawsuits, are prevented and all are happy and uncle Sam doesn't have to pay for mistakes that it has made in the past. And because they work the systems are written into policy. Until one day the recession of 2008 (or any other recession or depression or economic downturn or fiscally conservative congress).  People have to be laid off or you can only afford to pay people lower wages, bringing in less experienced and less skilled workforces.  Or both.  So for example sake, now we have a tiny workforce that is relatively unskilled or underpaid, handling a massive safety program that is policy and therefore required.  

This scenario, describes the government (and many large corporations too). So many 


##Technology

Above I used safety as a relatable example. And that is a problem. But it becomes an even bigger problem when you develop a similar system that is meant to protect the government from something that evolves as fast as, and is as important as, technology.  

How to handle technology within a government bureaucracy is one of the biggest challenges that the government faces to day (in my opinion).  Not only do we have an aging workforce that keeps us from trying new technologies, but we have a bloated security systems that prevent us from becoming safer and prevent us from using technologies that make us more efficient.  For example, for the longest time the Government refused to use any other web browser besides Internet Explorer 8 for safety reasons.  To anyone who was watching the browser [wars of the mid 2000s][browser] new that this was crazy.  Mozilla and Chrome proved to be the fastest and safest browsers over and over.  Yet the government refused to change (I was was required to use IE 8 until around 2013).  This really hurt the many agencies, because while the rest of the Internet world started to use all of these amazing new technologies, the government was patching IE 8 so that it was still safe and they continued to build websites for IE 8 that worked on no other browser.  They were essentially avoiding the day that we all knew was coming.  And it was costing them. Because after they finally did make the switch, they had to completely rebuild some websites and apps.  

To make things even worse, the government has been mired with [security issues][opmhack], making progress move even slower. 

##Change Faster

So how do we change this? How do we get the government to change faster? And should the government change faster? Even more importantly, should a workforce that is already strapped for time even be taking the time to think about these things? 

Making technological advancements brings two things, a change in productivity and and increase in information sharing. I'll admit, too much technological tinkering can decrease productivity.  However, increases in productivity, in my experience only come after having time to vet and explore a variety of technologies.  And that can take some time. I've been prone to experiment to death, at a cost to productivity.  But now I know about so many really cool tools that I use everyday, that make me a more productive employee.  (Like [Evernote][evernote]).  And the gov is huge, think of 2.7 million people testing new tech all of the time.  

To give you an idea of how this might work, look at web technologies. People are constantly creating new things and leaving old stuff behind.  The web is a little bit of a mess, but ultimately, you have advancements in the web happening really fast. Which is what we want, right?  Rapid advancement.  Open source software is also a great example.  So many great open source programs come out everyday that most people don't even know about.  Over time the really good ones come to the top and become known by the [general public][mozilla] while the rest are forgotten and never used again. That's what the government needs.  The ability to try a bunch of different technology, get rid of the bad stuff over time and gradually find what works best for it.  

Currently the opposite is happening.  You can only try very few programs that are tightly controlled by the gov, and are mostly out of date. When you want to try something new, approvals have to happen by someone who has no idea what you do.  We end up getting stuck using really antiquated systems that don't work very well. 

I'd hope that if we were more open to trying new tech we would solve the problem of how the gov shares information.  It boggles my mind how often I open my email to find a one sentence note with a single link that has been forwarded 10+ times.  Not only is this a waste of email space and employee time, but Twitter solved this  problem a long time ago. Tweets are limited in length (man I wish that our emails were limited in length) and they are great for linking.  Ninety nine percent of my email traffic would be eliminated if we used twitter efficiently.  If we eliminated wasteful email, the more important information would get through. I am by no means the only one advocating for the end of email.  Other people [have been saying this for a long time][email]. Other information improvements I would make are  I would Instead emailing Memos (the public ones) through email they could have a dedicated Facebook page, or twitter feed, or even maybe a website.  Instead, we get weekly emails that most employees ignore. 

The government is hesitant to use unofficial Twitter accounts or Facebook (they even once recommended we delete our social media accounts for protection) because they are afraid of someone saying something that will damage the image of the government.  And that's understandable.   Ultimately though, what we write as government employees [eventually gets out anyways][mms].  All government correspondence is subject to [Freedom of Information Act][FOIA] requests. So why are we so protective of the information that we could be sharing? Wouldn't it be better if actions of bad employees were public anyways?  Is the gov trying to hide a bade employee problem? In my experience NO.  So why not let them share. 

##Where do we go from here?   
I've been trying to get involved (it's hard) with people and arms of the gov who are trying to change this.  [18F][18F], [Ben Balter][Ben], [GitHub][github],[NASA][NASA], and the [USGS][USGS] all seem to be doing a fairly good job writing about and change
