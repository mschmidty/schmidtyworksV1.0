Bureaucracy is something that you must accept as a government employee, or you will go crazy.  And I have.  I told myself that the day that I got a gov job, that no matter how mundane the bureaucracy got, I would get it done, and not let it interfere with my job.  But recent attempts at trying to get two programs have changed my mind and after [reading around][fedramp], I think things need to change. 

##Money

The government is huge.  I mean the US federal government  [ budget was 4 trillion dollars][budget] in 2015.  As you can imagine, an entity with that much money tends to employ a lot of people, which the government does, approximately [2.7 million][workforce]. Like many large corporations with that many employees I, there are many systems the the government uses to keep some sort of order within such a large workforce. Some of these systems are very necessary such as a hiring staff or an accounting staff (often outsourced these days).  However, some of these systems tend to get very large very quickly and, because of their size, end up costing a ton of money.  

Government systems become large for many reasons, politics, money, very persuasive leaders, etc.  But one particular form of growth seems to be very destructive within the government.  A very common scenario is a government employee or user gets hurt, says the government agency whom they are connected to didn't do enough to protect them, so they sue.  Let's, in an imaginary scenario, assume that they [win][lawsuit] and their settlement costs uncle Sam a lot of money.  The government pays the settlement, and changes policy to prevent such a lawsuit in the future. As it should be, the government should try to protect their employees and users.  But now let's assume that it happens 100 times or 1,000 times.  Understandably the government starts to fear future suits and begins to institute safety precautions preemptively.  Now let's say that these new precautions work, so the system grows.  Injuries, and therefore lawsuits, are prevented and all are happy and uncle Sam doesn't have to pay for mistakes that it has made in the past. And because they work the systems are written into policy. Until one day the recession of 2008 (or any other recession or depression or economic downturn or fiscally conservative congress).  People have to be laid off or you can only afford to pay people lower wages, bringing in less experienced and less skilled workforces.  Or both.  So for example sake, now we have a tiny workforce that is relatively unskilled or underpaid, handling a massive safety program that is policy and therefore required.  

This scenario, describes the government (and many large corporations too). So many 


##Technology

Above I used safety as a relatable example. And that is a problem. But it becomes an even bigger problem when you develop a similar system that is meant to protect the government from something that evolves as fast as, and is as important as, technology.  

How to handle technology within a government bureaucracy is one of the biggest challenges that the government faces to day (in my opinion).  Not only do we have an aging workforce that keeps us from trying new technologies, but we have a bloated security systems that prevent us from becoming safer and prevent us from using technologies that make us more efficient.  For example, for the longest time the Government refused to use any other web browser besides Internet Explorer 8 for safety reasons.  To anyone who was watching the browser [wars of the mid 2000s][browser] new that this was crazy.  Mozilla and Chrome proved to be the fastest and safest browsers over and over.  Yet the government refused to change (I was was required to use IE 8 until around 2013).  This really hurt the many agencies, because while the rest of the Internet world started to use all of these amazing new technologies, the government was patching IE 8 so that it was still safe and they continued to build websites for IE 8 that worked on no other browser.  They were essentially avoiding the day that we all knew was coming.  And it was costing them. Because after they finally did make the switch, they had to completely rebuild some websites and apps.  

To make things even worse, the government has been mired with [security issues][opmhack], making progress move even slower. 

##Change Faster

So how do we change this? How do we get the government to change faster? And should the government change faster?
