Gunnison Sage-grouse (GUSG) was listed as [threatened][threatened] by the Fish and Wildlife Service on November 12, 2014. 

##Taxonomy


##Population Status
**Current Population**: approximately 4,500 individuals

Seven populations of GUSG remain in the United States, occupying 7% of there original range. The seven populations are (2014 population number): 

1. *Pinon Mesa* (182)
2. *Crawford* (157)
3. *San Miguel Basin* (204)
4. *Gunnison Basin* (3,976)
5. *Dove Creek/Monticello* (98)
6. *Poncha Pass* (10)
7. *Cerro Summit Cimmoron Sims Mesa* (74)

Six of the seven populations have been in decline over the last decade.  The Gunnison Basin population is the only population that has been stable to slightly increasing for the last 12 years. 


##Rationale For Listing

1. Present or threatened habitat loss or fragmentation
2. Overuse of commercial, recreational or educational purposes
3. Disease or predation
4. Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms
5. Other natural or man-made factors

GUSG rely completely on sagebrush steppe ecosystems.  Sagebrush ecosystems have long been degraded by a host of human activities.  Some of these activities, although not all, do not on the surface seem to be a burdon on the landscape such as: 

* Telephone, and electricle poles. 
* Roads and recreational trails
* Grazing (although not always). 
* Sepression of Fire
