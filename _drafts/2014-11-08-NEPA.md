If you are a federal land manager, the holy grail of all statutes is the [National Environmental Policy Act of 1970][nepawiki], or NEPA as most of us like to call it. So what exactly is NEPA and why is everyone always talking about it? 

Note: I am not a NEPA expert.  Far from it actually, if anyone out there is interested in contributing to this discussion that is a NEPA expert, I would love to hear from you or, even better, have you write a guest post. Contact me at schmidtyworks@gmail.com. 

##What is NEPA?

In the early 1960s, due to several environmental catastrophes, the United States started pressure the federal government to pass legislation that protected the environment.  Over the next decade and a half several environmental statues were passed, The Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act were passed.  NEPA quite possibly the most important pieces of legislation passed EVER! Since its passage several contries have passed similar legislation to protect the environment. NEPA was enacted to help federally funded projects consider environmental issues. The preamble lays out NEPA's purpose nicely: 

"To declare national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation..."
{: .quote }

tldr: NEPA helps us prevent environmental damage. 

Oddly enough if you are a federal employee you will see that many folks have begun to use NEPA as a verb; as in "have you completed the NEPA yet?".  So don't get confused if you the acronym used as a verb. 

##What is NEPA?

Basically, whenever a federal action occurs, NEPA requires that we analyze that actions affects on the natural environment. This allows both federal employees and the public to be informed of federal actions. Within the government, it allows biologists, ecologists, archaeologists, hydrologists, etc. to analyze effects of a project to the natural and cultural environment. 

##How is it Done?

So, what do federal agencies have to do to comply with NEPA? Well all actions have to be analyzed and documented in one or more of the following documents: 

1. **[Categorical Exclusion(CatEx)][catex]** are: 
"a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency... therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required._" ([40 C.F.R. ยง1508.4][catexcfr]) 
2. **[Environmental Assessment (EA):][ea]** If a proposed action does not fall within CatEx, your first step in the NEPA process is an EA. Through environmental analysis, two outcomes can result: (a) a finding of no significant impact (FONSI), in which case the project may continue; or (b) you find that the action will lead to **significant** impacts and further analysis is required in an: 
3.  **[Environmental Impact Statements (EIS):][eis]** are used to help make informed decisions on projects that will have **significant** environemtal effects. 

##So what is Significant
During the course of taking various introductory NEPA courses, I really couldn't figure out how.
