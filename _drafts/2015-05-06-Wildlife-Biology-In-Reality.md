I made the transition from Wildlife Technician to Wildlife Biologist about four months ago and, just like my transition from college to working as a technician, there were a few things that I didn't expect. 

##Biology can be frusterating at times

Admitedly the biggest transition from being a tech to a bio (which was always an odd destinction, because most of the time techs actually do more wildife biology than "wildlife biolgists"), was how much people disliked my decisions as a biolgist.  As a tech, everyone really likes biology.  They are often supportive, they really like the things that you are doing, and they seem to always be jealous of what you get to do as a biologist - even though wildlife biology is some of the hardest work that I have ever done.  

Alternitively, as a "Wildlife biologist", instead of collecting data all of the time, which I miss, you mostly sit at a desk and try and find ways that you can conserve habitat, or mitigate disturbance.  That sounds great right!  Well, it's great as long as it isn't preventing anyone from doing THEIR project.  I don't know why I never saw this before I was actually in the line of fire, but it really makes sense.  Protecting things, and making sacrifices sound great to anyone that is sitting on the sidelines sounds great, but when you are the one making sacrifices, they become very hard to swollow.  

For example, one of the current projects that I'm working on is.
