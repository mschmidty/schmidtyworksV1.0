**Date:** March 9 - 11, 2016.   **Location:** *Gunnison, Colorado*

##Wednesday

Morning session was not science centric. 

###History of Gunnison Sage-grouse

The morning sessions started with a history of management of Gunnison sage-grouse (hereafter referred to as grouse).  [Pat Magee][p magee] gave a nice history of all of conservation in the west over the last 200+ years. Some big points:

* At one time (late 1800s I thing), one hunter killed ~900 birds in one outing. 
* in 1900 there were 19.6 Million cattle and 25.1 million sheep.  A huge increase 4.1 million cattle from 50 years before. 
* Collaboration is important. 
* He had a table of all of the land action that have occurred over the course of the US that I'd like to get my hands on.  All purchases and treaties. 

###Other morning highlights

**Jim Cochran**: Presented on a habitat privatization tool.  It would be cool to apply this to our area. It isn't based on locations, but soils, aspect, and disturbance. 

**Local Rancher From Gunnison**:  How do we balance restoration and conservation from grazing, without causing further fragmentation from the lack of grazing and ranches? Ranchers keep large tracts of land in conservation easements. 

**Drought**:  Major Drought in the southwest from 2002 to 2003 that caused major sage die offs.  Dry Creek Basin was largely effective. 

**Habitat Improvement**: From *Mapping of Gunnison Sage-grouse habitat and landscape relationships in Crawford*.  Looked at 12 radio collared birds.  There was no selection for habitat improvement areas, except for plow and seed habitat treatments. NO PRE TREATMENT SURVEYS ON THIS.   

###Habitat Models
Many different habitat models were presented in the afternoon.  To be honest it seemed that of the three presented only [Aldridge's][Aldridge] was worth wild.  His model predicted seasonal use in small areas (~13%) of the total range and encompassed ~90 percent of all of the use.  It was really amazing in comparison to some of the other models presented throughout the day. 

###Habitat Improvement Model
Model that showed that PJ removal can greatly increase the amount of available habitat.  

### Genetics

Tere were several really good talks on GUSG Genetics.  

**Genetic Diferences in Gunnison and Greater Sage-grouse.  [Sara Oyler-McCance][Sara OM]**: The talked about Genomics vs Genetics.  We are at a point where we can literally map whole genomes instead of looking at specific genes. 

Greater Sage-grouse and the Bi-State populations are both genetically variable.  Gunnison sage-grouse show  very little genetic variability.  Thinks they went through a bottle neck at one point. 

**Genetic implications of Gunnison Sage-grouse translocations. [Shawna Zimmerman][s zimmerman]** Basically translocations that have occurred from Gunnison to the Satellite populations have lead to shared genetics.  A sign that reproduction has occured within the populations. 

**The Gunnison Sage-grouse Genome. [Kevin Oh][Kevin Oh]**
This was the best talk of the day.  Kevin talked about Genomics and mapping the entire sequence of the Gunnison Sage-grouse.  Biggest thing was that they showed that Sage-grouse, in general have specific enzymes that differ from other Chickens, that allow for digestion of sage.  He also showed that it is likely that GUSG were geographically isolated some time in the last ice age, ~36000 years ago.  I'd Really like to get a hold of his power point. 

##Thursdsay

**Sagebrush Resilience to stress and disturbance and resistance to Cheatgrass Invasion. [Jeanne Chambers][Jeanne Chambers]** Higher elevations sites are less susceptible to cheatgrass invasions. They are more resistant because their is generally more competition because there is more moisture.  Jeannes name is linked to her major publication on the subject. 

**Other interesting tidbits.**  

* In Gunnison, they are seeing large die offs of sagebrush due to drought. Meaning climate change may have some drastic impacts on sagebrush. *Jonathan Coop*.
* Russ Jupuntich talked a lot about road closures and timing restrictions that the Gunnison Basin. He mentioned dead planing roads, something that I thought was clever and worth a shot in our upcoming travel management. 
* **NDVI** a GIS technique measuring the chlorophyll in plants.  This was a major theme throughout the conference.  I've played around with it a little but but not much.
