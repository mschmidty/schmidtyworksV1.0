It is my absolute pleasure to recommend Anna Ortega for the Graduate Research Fellowship Program with the National Science Foundation.  Anna worked for me at the Bureau of Land Management, Tres Rios Field Office for six months in 2016 in the Wildlife Biology department.  I am a Wildlife Biologist and field crew supervisor that runs the riparian and wildlife programs for our office.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Anna, and came to know her as a truly valuable asset to our team.    

##Detail of What Anna Did

Anna contributed to several projects while she worked for me, but her main focus was mapping approximately 60,000 acres of Gunnison sage-grouse critical habitat. This task was made up of three parts: 

1. Qualitatively ground truthing polygon delineations and classifying polygons based on density and vegetation type
2. Quantitatively analyzing a subset of polygons
3. Organizing and entering data into a versioned geodatabase

The entire process was three parts field work and one part data management in the office.  Field days were long and hot in the Colorado desert.  Office days consisted of organizing a versioned geodatabase, pushing changes to a master version will colloaborating with collegues also working on serparate versions of the same database.  Each par of this process took communication and patients - particularly because of federal computer restrictions. Anna took it all in stride.  Her strengths as a botanist were used as a foundation for her in this program, something she was hired for.  She was often relied upon by the crew for her plant expertise and her ability to key out plants to species. Additionally, her experience with the Co-op in Whyoming gave her an excellent background in modern data storage and analysis techniques, something that is becoming more and more important as biological technologies advance. 

Admittedly, our process was limited by the fact that we could not use the most modern technology to speed up the data colleciton process due to cost.  Anna helped work out solutions that were effecient but practical to complete the work she was tasked with.   
##Why she was good at it

I have had the chance to work with several intelegent, young scientist throughout my career.  Anna stands out from others because of her attention to small details and her willingness to do extra work in order to capture those details.  Many  young biologists that I have worked with are enamored with the world outside and so choose the field of biology to follow their passion for the field.  Anna is different.  She  is extremely interested with the natural world and how it works.  She is constantly asking questions, always attempting to get a better understanding how what we are doing fits into management.  For example as part of working with
