I can't be here to say this to you in person because I'm currently attending a meeting with the Fish and Wildlife Service, CPW and the NRCS to discuss sage-grouse issues in Dove Creek.  

First I want to say thank you for coming down to the Tres Rios.  I know Dolores is as far away from Denver as it gets - so I appreciate you making the trip.  Second, I want you to know that, although I'm about to offer some criticisms to you, I wholeheartedly respect how difficult your job is and I have the utmost respect for what you do. I have a hard time managing half of a wildlife program in one field office.  So thank you for what you do at such an unimaginable scale. 

To my point.  

I've worked in this office for 8 years.  During that time the stae office has been, at least in part, responsible for four major changes: 

1.  Adding a district office level of management.
2.  Ending Service First. 
3.  Implementing Budget Allocation Models
4.  Redistricting and re-aligning of the field offices. 

Four major changes in 8 years.  Why? 

I'm sure that you will hear from many of my coworkers today, and I expect they will express their frustrations about how we have no voice and about how these decisions were made not because of on the ground management, but because it made more sense on a map or in a document. I'll let them take care of those things and I hope you listen.  But what I want to ask, or even request, is that you stop changing things. 

It seems like every time we adjust to something new, there's another change made.  Every time we get over the fact that you have made a major change without asking what we thought, you change something else.  And just when we start to settle in, another discomforting change occurs.  And for gods sake, stop sending emails out late on a Friday.  That is the most stereotypical crap boss move in the book.  And yet it keeps happening. At the very least, if you take one thing away from this, please know that we are tired of having our weekends ruined. All of this stuff that you keep changing, we are constantly having to adjust to.  Trying to figure out.  It adds to our workload significantly. Did I mention that these last eight years have been during a recession, when time is something that none of us has.  Remember time = money.  And we have not had a lot of money. 

So, I've given my complaint, now what are my solutions.  I have 6.

1. Make no major changes for a decade. No redistricting, no changes to organizational charts, no management layer changes, no budget funding changes.  Please let us learn the processes you have put in place and give us time to become proficient in them. 

2.  Please work on minor inefficiencies.  How as a state can we have less paperwork, hire people more efficiently and get them computer access without submitting 20 different tickets. 

3.  Update our website and the policies surrounding it so we can actually use it as a tool for us and the public's sake.  Our web presence is pathetic at best and it is almost useless for the public and your employees.  18F is a GSA organization that is working with agencies to help with government agencies with the web.  Use them. 

4. Work on a wellness program for your employees.  The Colorado BLM is living in the past. Our Forest Service counterparts get 6 hours of wellness time a pay period. We get zero.  At this point I'd be happy with one.  Wellness time increases employee productivity. 

5. Figure out how to get young people jobs before your whole staff retires.  Permanent seasonal GS-5 through 7, 13/13 positions might cost you a little more than your average seasonal, but having them saves so much time for your staff.  I have two great seasonals.  The summer they walk away, is the summer that I will do no NEPA. 

6. Stop sending us surveys that we know will lead to no changes!
